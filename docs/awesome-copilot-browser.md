# Feature Specification: Awesome GitHub Copilot Browser

## Overview

A VS Code extension that provides an explorer view to browse, preview, and download GitHub Copilot customizations (chat modes, instructions, and prompts) from the awesome-copilot repository. Users can filter items by filename, preview content, and selectively download files to their workspace with proper GitHub Copilot folder structure.

## User Journey

1. **Open Explorer View**: User opens the "Awesome Copilot" view in the VS Code Explorer panel
2. **Browse Categories**: User sees three expandable sections: Chat Modes, Instructions, and Prompts
3. **Filter Content**: User types in filter textbox to narrow down items by filename
4. **Preview Item**: User clicks on an item to see name and content preview
5. **Select for Download**: User clicks download button on desired item
6. **Confirm Download**: System prompts user to confirm download location and filename
7. **File Downloaded**: Item is saved to appropriate `.github/` folder structure in current workspace

     - [ ] Option to overwrite or rename existing files

7. **FR-07**: Status and Feedback
   - **Description**: Provide user feedback during operations
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Loading indicator while fetching repository data
     - [ ] Success notification after successful download
     - [ ] Error messages for failed operations
     - [ ] Progress indication for multiple downloads

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Initial load should complete within 10 seconds on normal internet connection
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when GitHub API is unavailable
- **Usability**: Interface follows VS Code design patterns and accessibility guidelines
- **Caching**: Repository data cached for 1 hour, with manual refresh option

## Out of Scope

- Editing downloaded files within the extension
- Uploading custom files back to the repository
- Integration with GitHub authentication for private repositories
- Automatic updates of downloaded files
- Search functionality beyond simple filename filtering
- Bulk download of multiple files simultaneously
