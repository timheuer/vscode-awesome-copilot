A VS Code extension that allows you to browse, preview, and download GitHub Copilot customizations from the [awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot).

## Features

- **üíæ Caching**: Smart caching for better performance

## How to Use

1. **Open the Extension**: Click the new Activity Bar icon (checkmark document) titled **Awesome Copilot**. (Previously this view appeared under Explorer; it now has its own dedicated container with a proper icon.)
2. **Browse Categories**: Expand Chat Modes, Instructions, or Prompts sections
3. **Preview Content**: Click the preview icon on any file to see its content
4. **Download Files**: Click the download icon to save files to your workspace
5. **Refresh Data**: Click the refresh icon in the view title to update repository data

## Folder Structure

Downloaded files are organized in your workspace as follows:

- **Chat Modes** ‚Üí `.github/chatmodes/`
- **Instructions** ‚Üí `.github/instructions/`  
- **Prompts** ‚Üí `.github/prompts/`

These folders will be created automatically if they don't exist.

## Requirements

- VS Code version 1.103.0 or higher
- Internet connection to fetch repository data
- A workspace folder open in VS Code (for downloads)

## Extension Commands

- `Refresh`: Update repository data from GitHub
- `Download`: Save a file to your workspace
- `Preview`: View file content in VS Code

## Development

This extension was built with:

- TypeScript
- VS Code Extension API
- Axios for HTTP requests
- ESBuild for bundling

### Building

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Testing  

```bash
npm run test
```

## UI Placement / Custom View Container

The extension contributes a custom Activity Bar view container named **Awesome Copilot**. If you prefer to move or hide it:

- Right-click the Activity Bar to toggle visibility.
- Drag the view into a different location if desired (VS Code will persist your layout).

If you previously dragged the old Explorer-based view into the Activity Bar and saw a generic label/icon, this update fixes that by supplying a dedicated container with themed icons (light/dark).

**Enjoy browsing and using awesome GitHub Copilot customizations!**
